Python 3 is recommended for this lab. Python 2 works as well if you adapt the installation instructions.

Installation instructions for straightforward pip install below.

If you are a power user under a specific Python environment ((virtualenv, anaconda,
docker), please visit tensorflow.org and follow the Python 3 instructions.

MacOS:
	If you do not have it already, install git from https://git-scm.com/download/mac
	Install the latest version of python 3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/
	pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow
	pip3 install --upgrade matplotlib

Ubuntu/Linux:
	sudo -H apt-get install git
	sudo -H apt-get install python3
	sudo -H apt-get install python3-matplotlib
	sudo -H apt-get install python3-pip
	sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow

Windows:
	Install Anaconda, Python 3 version: https://www.continuum.io/downloads#windows
	Anaconda comes with matplotlib built in.
	Open Anaconda prompt and type the following:
	conda create -tensorflow python=3.5 (type y, do not press the Enter key)
	activate tensorflow
	pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-1.0.0rc2-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
	pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade matplotlib
	TROUBLESHOOTING: If at any time you would like to re-create a conda environment, type the following (if you're in th:
	deactivate tensorflow
	Then, go to c:/Users/<your Windows identity>/Anaconda3/envs and delete the "tensorflow" folder.
	Follow the conda steps stated above again to re-install TensorFlow via conda and pip.
	IMPORTANT NOTE: This installation uses CPU, which is slower than GPU processing, but will ensure that all computers can be supported. If youwould rather use GPU, follow the steps to install CUDA here:
	Then, replace the pip install URL to https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-1.0.0rc2-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl 

Windows/Virtualbox:
	Install Virtualbox from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
	Create an Linux/Ubuntu virtual machine and install Ubuntu from http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/
	[Optional: In the virtual machine install Virtualbox helpers (allows screen resolution changes) using:
	 sudo -H apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso
	 sudo -H apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms
	 Open “Additional drivers” app and check that the “Virtualbox Graphics Adapter” and “Virtualbox Guest Service” are selected.]
	Shut down the virtual machine, max out its Video RAM and CPU settings, allocate 4GB of RAM and restart.
	Now go to Ubuntu/Linux section.

TEST YOUR INSTALLATION:
    git clone https://github.com/martin-gorner/tensorflow-mnist-tutorial.git
    cd tensorflow-mnist-tutorial
    python3 mnist_1.0_softmax.py
    => A window should appear displaying a graphical visualisation and you should also see training data in the terminal.
